SkillsUSA Cybersecurity State Competition ‚Äì Event Breakdown & Insights  

We were asked a single interview question in the beginning (to be used as a tie breaker). Mine was How would you respond to a user submitted complaint of a phishing email?

The SkillsUSA Cybersecurity competition consists of 8 unique security-focused scenarios (Virtual Machines), each designed to test a range of real-world IT and cybersecurity skills. Competitors are given 30 minutes per box, with only two accessible at a time. The remaining boxes unlock progressively as tasks are completed or time expires. Strong time management and technical versatility are key to success.

üñ•Ô∏è Windows Environments

1. Windows 10 Home ‚Äì User & Permission Management  
This task focused on creating and managing local user accounts, assigning group memberships, and configuring file/folder permissions. 

2. Windows Server ‚Äì Command Line Administration  
This station required all work to be done via command line (no GUI). Competitors had to use PowerShell/CMD utilities to manage users, groups, and system configurations ‚Äî  knowledge of administrative scripting and command syntax helped alot. 

3. Malware Removal ‚Äì Hidden Rootkit  
A Windows machine was infected with a rootkit that caused automatic logouts every few minutes. Windows Defender failed to detect it, requiring the use of third-party antivirus tools and manual investigation to identify and remove the threat.

4. Proxy Settings & Shortcut Permissions (Microsoft Edge)  
This task involved resolving broken internet connectivity caused by incorrect proxy settings and a corrupted Edge shortcut. The shortcut pointed to an invalid location, and its file permissions were misconfigured. Fixes included adjusting file properties, restoring correct permissions, and re-configuring proxy settings.

5. PowerShell Admin Scripting Challenge  
This task required creating a folder titled `Logs`, then writing four separate PowerShell scripts with distinct administrative functions:
   - A script that interacts with Task Manager to monitor or manage processes.
   - A script for managing or retrieving PowerShell execution settings.
   - A script for creating or managing users.
   - A fourth custom script demonstrating additional PowerShell skills (e.g., scheduled tasks, service management, or file cleanup).



üêß Linux & Network Tasks

6. Log Rotation Troubleshooting ‚Äì Linux  
A misconfigured logrotate.conf file caused log rotation to fail. Competitors had to identify and correct syntax errors to restore proper log management ‚Äî testing knowledge of Linux configuration and log maintenance.

7. Firewall & Proxy Configuration  
This station focused on identifying and correcting firewall and proxy misconfigurations that were blocking network access. Basic networking and firewall rule knowledge were essential here.

üîç Digital Forensics

8. Autopsy ‚Äì Forensic Analysis & Reporting  
Competitors used the Autopsy digital forensics platform to analyze a disk image and generate a report. Tasks included locating key evidence, creating timelines, exporting findings, and properly documenting results.



‚úÖ Key Takeaways for Future Competitors:

- Be familar with PowerShell. It was used heavily across Windows-based tasks ‚Äî scripting efficiency really helps.
- Be comfortable with no-GUI environments. Several tasks were CLI-only.
- Practice malware analysis. Built-in tools won‚Äôt always be enough ‚Äî know how to use third-party options.
- Understand both Windows and Linux administration. Expect configuration file issues, permissions errors, and networking misconfigurations.
- Know your forensics tools. Learn Autopsy‚Äôs layout, functions, and reporting tools ahead of time.
- Time management is critical. With only 30 minutes per box and two open at a time, efficiency is just as important as technical skill.
- If you run out of time just move on, its no big deal. Just try your best and try not to stress about it to much. 

You have a teammate for a reason, Work together. If the challage is easy, dont be afriad to divide and concor or both focus on the same one.
